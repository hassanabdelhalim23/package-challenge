# Project Title

package-challenge

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


## Running the tests

mvn clean install 


there will be a jar file on the target 

run the java -jar package-challenge-0.0.1 path of file 


### Desgin Patterns

my idea is make the code loosely coupled by using Dependency Injection with help of factory pattern desgin pattern  so now every class is independent from each other we can test . any other changes to objects will not lead us to change code



### algorithms
the best solution is dynamic programming as the problems are overlapping. and this is a known problem (i depend on it for solving this problem and read some articls about it) NOTE could be done smarter than which i implment but i will give a another try for that
